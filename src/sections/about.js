                        I'm currently studing at AGH University in Poland. When
                        I graduate I want to persude my carrer as a Software
                        Enginner. My goal is to build scalable and fast
                        applications while keeping user experience and visuals
                        as clean as possible. To make it happen, I was exploring
                        new technologies over the years.

                    <Typography tag='span' variant='body'>
                        Here are a few of them Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
                    </Typography>
                    <Itemlist items={skills} />
                </Stack>
                <Profile />
            </Inner>
        </AboutSection>
    );
};

export default About;
